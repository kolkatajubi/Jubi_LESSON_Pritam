        The range of elements processed by findIndex is set before the first
        invocation of callback. callback will not process the elements appended
        to the array after the call to findIndex begins. If an existing,
        unvisited element of the array is changed by callback, its value passed
        to the callback will be the value at the time findIndex visits the
        element's index. Elements that are deleted are still visited
